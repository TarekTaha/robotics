2d Data Matrix Plugin
=====================================
The increase in popularity of the 2d Data matrices and the wide spread of mobile phone imaging devices (majority of nokia mobiles nowadays have barcode reader applications) that are capable of decoding these matrices inspired me to create this plugin. This plugin allows you to create a data matrix image that encodes your website or any other data. Most probably i will extend this plugin with more functionalities later on to allow you to encode any kind of data.

Future upcoming Additions
=====================================
1- Ability to encode more than one data matrix.
2- Add a matrix icon to each news item that will allow you to encode the link of that news item.
3- Encode user's details into a matrix so that you can simply image scan his data and save it.

Just install this plugin and modify the settings and that's it. Enjoy it and please send me your requests and recommendations to further improve this plugin.
